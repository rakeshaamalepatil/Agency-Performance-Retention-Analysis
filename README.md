# Power BI Project ‚Äì Agency Performance & Retention Analysis

## üìä Project Overview
This Power BI project analyzes agency-level performance using metrics like **Written Premium**, **Retention Ratio**, **Loss Ratio**, and **Growth Rate**, helping identify the most consistent and profitable agencies across multiple years.

The dataset (`finalapi.csv`) includes agency, product line (CL/PL), and year-wise performance records, allowing deep dives into business trends from various perspectives.

---

## üéØ Objectives
- Analyze agency performance and retention over time.
- Compare **Commercial Line (CL)** vs **Personal Line (PL)**.
- Identify **Top 10 Agencies/States** based on retention.
- Understand factors affecting **growth, loss ratio, and hit ratio**.
- Build a **clear, interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize trends and KPIs.

## üß© Dataset Highlights
**Main columns used:**
- `AGENCY_ID`, `PRIMARY_AGENCY_ID`
- `STATE_ABBR`, `PROD_LINE`, `PROD_ABBR`
- `STAT_PROFILE_DATE_YEAR` (Year)
- `WRTN_PREM_AMT`, `PREV_WRTN_PREM_AMT`, `NB_WRTN_PREM_AMT`
- `RETENTION_RATIO`, `LOSS_RATIO`, `GROWTH_RATE_3YR`
- `ACTIVE_PRODUCERS`, `AGENCY_APPOINTMENT_YEAR`
- `CL_*` and `PL_*` columns (Hit Ratio, Quote Counts, Bound Counts)

**Data Cleaning:**
- Replaced all placeholder values `99999` ‚Üí `null`.
- Adjusted column data types (e.g., Date, Decimal, Whole Number).
- Created a few new calculated columns:
  - `YEAR_DATE` (Date)
  - `HIT_FLAG` (Binary)
  - `POLICY_SIZE_BAND` (Text Category)

## üßÆ Measures Created
Key measures designed in DAX:

| Measure Name | Formula Description |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Total Written Premium** | `SUM('finalapi'[WRTN_PREM_AMT])` |
| **Previous Premium** | `SUM('finalapi'[PREV_WRTN_PREM_AMT])` |
| **Growth %** | `(Total - Previous) / Previous` |
| **Retention Ratio** | `SUM('finalapi'[RETENTION_POLY_QTY]) / SUM('finalapi'[POLY_INFOR_CEL_QTY])` |
| **Loss Ratio** | `SUM('finalapi'[PRD_INCRD_LOSSES_AMT]) / [Total Written Premium]` |
| **Hit Ratio** | `SUM('finalapi'[HIT_FLAG]) / COUNTROWS('finalapi')` |
| **Total Active Producers** | `SUM('finalapi'[ACTIVE_PRODUCERS])` |
